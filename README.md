This repository contains a React application demonstrating a common issue with React Router Dom: routes not rendering correctly. The issue arises when the routes are defined but the components do not display.  This is likely due to a mismatch in path definitions, component imports, or incorrect usage of the `Routes` and `Route` components.

The `App.js` file contains the buggy code.  The solution is provided in `AppSolution.js`.
